This allowed us to evolve Android-PC project into a toolkit that could also build multiple versions of a Bliss OS, along with AOSP. So seeing the potential there, we started working on the scripts, more and more. Adding the ability to create a PC .iso for just about any ROM out there, not just Bliss. After that we then boiled it all down to one vendor repo to clone into the AOSP or ROM source."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"With that main groundwork laid out, we then added the treble (GSI) scripts based off the same PHH-Treble concept we started using in Android Pie, and updated those with all the new functionality added for the PC side of things.

So with multiple ROMs applying the same set of generic patches, we quickly figured out that we will need to split things up for the patches. So the process for both GSI & PC patches all start with a pre-patch phase to allow for any reverts or other preparation a ROM source might need, then after that we apply a generic patchset (usually the base set that applies straight to AOSP), then after that we have a second ROM specific patch set to add any conflict resolutions that occur from the initial process of configuring for you ROM. Then after that is all set, we also have a Customization patch set type. Think AOSP vs. AOSP-EX, or Lineage vs Lineage-EX. In this phase of patching, it will look for any rom add-ons, added patches for customizations, features, etc, on top of what the ROM has currently."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"After that we set out to make the whole thing work more efficiently, adding the ability for new patch conflicts in one ROM to seek out other potential conflict resolutions on its own from the resolutions other ROMs have in the AG repo, so the more ROMs included in the main Android-Generic repo, the more ROMs that will be able to use it out of the box, benefiting the entire community."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Now for GSI, some may be thinking that PHH-Treble already uses a patching system and scripts, why would this be used?
