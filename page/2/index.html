Users can disregard this post.</em></p><p>We’re looking for potential maintainers for our next version of BlissRoms, BlissRoms 14!</p><p>For this year, we are tightening up our maintainer application process and imposing certain requirements for new maintainers. All new maintainers must meet the following criteria to be accepted, barring any special circumstances. If you do not meet the requirements but believe you have a unique reason to be accepted, please reach out to the administrators at Team Bliss.</p><ol><li>You need to understand English. Many of our internal documentation and tools are written in English. In the past we’ve had some unfortunate instances where maintainers did not understand our directives and caused problems. Therefore, all maintainers must have a reasonable comprehension of English in order to be accepted.</li><li>Your device must be buildable. Please do not apply in the hopes of getting your device maintained by us. That’s not what this program is for.</li><li>Build artifacts must be flashable as-is, without any modification. Unzipping and swapping out the kernel image, editing system files to force certain features to work, etc., are not allowed. Build artifacts should retain their original file name.</li><li>You should be able to use Linux, <code>git</code>, and Gerrit. In addition, you may have to run Python scripts on machines you are building ROMs on to upload your builds.</li><li>You must have a commit history on GitHub for at least 1 year.</li><li>All device trees (including kernel and vendor) <strong>must</strong> be public at the time of application, barring any legal problems like DMCA takedown requests. Particularly, if your vendor repository is prone to DMCA takedowns, please reach out to an admin before applying. <strong>There are no exceptions for device/kernel trees.</strong> Dependencies of the device tree (such as supporting libraries) must be public as well.</li><li>You must release builds every two weeks, minimum. Please set aside enough time for maintaining your device.</li></ol><p>Also, this year we are dropping the requirement for XDA threads. If you hate interacting with entitled users then you don’t have to! We are also dropping the requirement for support groups on Telegram.</p><p>All maintainers and developers of Team Bliss must abide by our ToC. These are really basic conditions, so don’t worry about signing away your soul or anything. These terms mainly deal with common decency to others and regulations like the above to agree to.</p><p>If you understand everything above, you may sign up for maintainership here: <a href="https://maintainers.blissroms.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://maintainers.blissroms.org/</a></p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/2020-09-26-sign-ups-for-q-now-closing">Sign ups for Q now closing</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-26T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 26, 2020</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_8c0z"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_9q7L" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13326074?v=4" alt="Eric Park"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Eric Park</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Backend Engineer @ BlissLabs</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Note: this post is for developers and maintainers looking to join Team Bliss.

Exciting time of the year. iOS 14 is coming out soon, right?</p><p>...I’m kidding! I know you guys are itching for the Android 11 builds, so before we start this month’s worth of announcements, I want to briefly touch on these points below.</p><header><h1>When will Android 11 come out?</h1></header><p>Android 11 came out a couple of days ago, so obviously we should have a build ready to go for everyone, right?</p><p>Well, no. That’s not how this works. The bring-up for Android 11 will be a tedious and long process and it will definitely need help, in the form of people spamming our chats asking for the latest and greatest Android 11 BlissRoms build.</p><p>...I’m obviously being sarcastic. Don’t do this. Please!</p><p>Asking for ETAs is a big no-no in the Android community, and if you don’t know this already just try going to the forum on XDA-Developers and ask when a custom Android 11 build will be out. You’ll be banned before you can finish asking “ETA?!”</p><p>So don’t ask us.</p><p>That being said, we have a general timeline set for beta releases in a couple of months, and general releases after that. <strong>This is not a concrete timeline and it is subject to change at any time.</strong> So please don’t message us and say that we lied when we don’t ship builds in a couple of months. We didn’t. You just didn’t read our announcement fully.</p><header><h1>Will my device be supported in Android 11?</h1></header><p>Right now, we cannot be sure. So please don’t ask about this, too.</p><p>Oh, speaking of device support…</p><header><h1>Unofficial builds are unofficial builds</h1></header><p>We are happy to see that members of the community are adding support for devices that are not on the official roster, by building unofficial builds. However, we would like to remind you that as much as we are grateful to developers and maintainers helping to create a better ROM community, <strong>we cannot endorse these builds in any capacity.</strong></p><p>This has particularly become an issue as some unofficial maintainers have begun to launch builds to “compete” with official builds, claiming more functionality and bug fixes. We have even received a number of abuse reports from maintainers, claiming that unofficial maintainers are encouraging users to threaten or harass the official maintainer, sometimes doing it themselves. We never condone this type of behavior and we are really saddened to see how abusive some members of the community have become. Please do not support this behavior yourself and steer clear of builds built by these toxic members of the community.</p><p>Another issue with unofficial builds is support. <strong>We cannot support devices we don’t own.</strong> We just can’t do it. Period. This means whatever bug or snag you run across while running an unofficial build should be forwarded to the unofficial builder, <strong>not</strong> us. Our public community chat on Telegram is only focused on providing support for official builds, and not unofficial builds. We just don’t have the capacity to do it. Sorry.</p><p>If you, as a developer, would like to build official builds, then please consider applying to our maintainer program at Team Bliss. We have instructions on how to do just that on our community chat.</p><p>Oh, right. Regarding the community chat…</p><header><h1>Spam moderation in community chat</h1></header><p>In the past month we’ve seen an uptick in spam, particularly threatening and abusive messages from trolls. We are trying our best to filter them out, however we cannot be available 24/7 and some of these messages may slip through the cracks.</p><p>If you notice any bad messages on our community chat, use the <code>/report</code> flag while replying to the offending message to report the message to admins. Also, right click on the message and select “Report Message,” then select the appropriate abuse reason. This will alert the Telegram team to the abuse and they will be able to shut the spammer down.</p><p>We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working towards a solution that will preemptively block spammers before they even join. Further details will be announced soon. Thanks!</p><header><h1>Updated OTA announcement</h1></header><p>We recently overhauled our downloads infrastructure and that caused some of our server API URLs to change. As a result, the old OTA app bundled with old builds of BlissRoms will no longer work.</p><p>To check if you have the old OTA app:</p><ul><li>If your BlissRoms build was released after <strong>August 23rd</strong>, then no need to worry! You already have the patched OTA app.</li><li>If your BlissRoms build won’t update even if there is a new version listed online it’s possible your build does not have the patched OTA app.</li></ul><p>If you are on a build before August 23rd, please update manually by downloading and flashing a new build <code>.zip</code>. You only need to do this once!</p><p>In the future, we are looking at OTA-OTA solutions (sounds weird, right?) so that users do not have to repeat this. We’re sorry for the inconvenience!</p><p>Great, so let’s see what changed this month for BlissRoms!</p><header><h1>Feature additions</h1></header><ul><li><strong>The September security patch has been merged!</strong> Thanks to @jackeagle for the merge 🙂</li><li>Added toggle for carrier group visibility</li><li>Added support for MiSound FX and DiracSound FX</li><li>Improved lockscreen nav Pulse</li><li>Added music card in volume panel</li><li>Improved FOD</li><li>Added centered R-style notification headers</li><li>Added ambient screen Pulse</li><li>Improved SystemUI</li><li>Added volume plugins</li><li>Added toggle for gradient background in QS panel</li><li>Added setting to add minimum auto brightness value</li><li>Face authentication now automatically blocks when the device is in a pocket</li><li>Clicking on the QS data usage toggle now opens the data panel</li><li>Aligned music card vertically to volume panel</li><li>Added option to force custom Doze brightness</li><li>Made ringer icon optional in volume panel</li><li>Asus Longshot is now the default screenshot system!</li><li>Moved Dark Mode to Blissify Settings</li><li>Added dependencies to system themes</li></ul><p>Bug fixes</p><ul><li>Fixed “Edit QS panel” icon touch issue</li><li>Fixed battery QS tile icon not changing. The detail for it was also removed.</li><li>Fixed “remove lockscreen default shortcuts”</li></ul><p>And that’s it for this month! Have a good one and see you in the next update post!</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/2020-09-05-android-generic-project">Android-Generic Project</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 5, 2020</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_8c0z"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_9q7L" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13326074?v=4" alt="Eric Park"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Eric Park</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Backend Engineer @ BlissLabs</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For the longest time, the Android-x86 world has been plagued with not having a proper recovery toolset packaged with the OS. There have been a few attempts at such a solution in the past, but nothing that was able to coincide with the main Android system and work together. Until <a href="https://supreme-gamers.com/threads/gearlock-custom-recovery-replacement-for-android-x86.169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gearlock</a> came into play. It started as a toolkit to do many of the underlying troubleshooting within a basic UI for Phoenix-OS, Remix-OS, etc. And by working together with the lead developer, Axon, we were able to work out a solution for all Android-x86 based projects. Just clone vendor-gearlock into your AOSP based project, run one command, and it’s ready to go. The result is a recovery/tweaking solution that can be run along side system, and also acts as a pre-bootloader for the main OS, so you can in fact choose to boot into Recovery first if you desire.</p><p>Here’s a little preview I tweeted, giving a quick glance of some of the options available.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#x27;s a little preview of a few things Gearlock is able to provide for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AndroidGenericProject?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AndroidGenericProject</a>&#x27;s Android 10 builds Thanks goes out to Axon for all the work on Gearlock lately ;) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllROMsAreBlissful?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AllROMsAreBlissful</a> <a href="https://t.co/loKR4IFzFa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/loKR4IFzFa</a></p>— Jon West (@electrikjesus) <a href="https://twitter.com/electrikjesus/status/1302032014636441605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>We’ve also been further integrating more and more ROMs into Android-Generic Project, Lineage OS 17.1 being the latest. And <a href="https://github.com/boringdroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boringdroid</a> developer, @utzcoz (Also the newest member of Team Bliss!!!) has also been hard at work in the Android Desktop UI development world, so we’ve been mostly testing all the changes under the hood there with the recent Lineage OS test builds, but have plans on continuing the ROM bringup game soon.</p><p>Again, if you are interested in learning more about Android-Generic Project or Android-x86 development in general, be sure to check out our <a href="https://gitlab.com/android-generic/vendor_android-generic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project readme</a>. It has quite a few learning resources as well as plenty of documentation on the process.</p><p>And as a gauge of interest, we would like to know how many of you out there would be interested in watching the entire bring up process for a ROM, maybe streamed on Twitch someplace we could interact with those watching, and if so, what ROM would you all like to see added? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p>Thanks again.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/2020-08-21-updates-w3-august-2020">Updates (W3, August 2020)</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 21, 2020</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_8c0z"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_9q7L" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13326074?v=4" alt="Eric Park"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Eric Park</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Backend Engineer @ BlissLabs</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>BlissRoms v12.11 is out!

Recently, the development on Bliss OS has taken a different turn towards something that can better benefit the entire community.</p><p>We’ve taken the concept of our Android-PC project, and started to rework the scripts to make things a whole lot smarter and easier to use. This allowed us to evolve Android-PC project into a toolkit that could also build multiple versions of a Bliss OS, along with AOSP. So seeing the potential there, we started working on the scripts, more and more. Adding the ability to create a PC .iso for just about any ROM out there, not just Bliss. After that we then boiled it all down to one vendor repo to clone into the AOSP or ROM source.</p><p>With that main groundwork laid out, we then added the treble (GSI) scripts based off the same PHH-Treble concept we started using in Android Pie, and updated those with all the new functionality added for the PC side of things. Making this project now require a new name, Android-Generic.</p><p>Next step was to make it smarter. So with multiple ROMs applying the same set of generic patches, we quickly figured out that we will need to split things up for the patches. So the process for both GSI &amp; PC patches all start with a pre-patch phase to allow for any reverts or other preparation a ROM source might need, then after that we apply a generic patchset (usually the base set that applies straight to AOSP), then after that we have a second ROM specific patch set to add any conflict resolutions that occur from the initial process of configuring for you ROM. Then after that is all set, we also have a Customization patch set type. Think AOSP vs. AOSP-EX, or Lineage vs Lineage-EX. In this phase of patching, it will look for any rom add-ons, added patches for customizations, features, etc, on top of what the ROM has currently.</p><p>After that we set out to make the whole thing work more efficiently, adding the ability for new patch conflicts in one ROM to seek out other potential conflict resolutions on its own from the resolutions other ROMs have in the AG repo, so the more ROMs included in the main Android-Generic repo, the more ROMs that will be able to use it out of the box, benefiting the entire community.</p><p>Now for GSI, some may be thinking that PHH-Treble already uses a patching system and scripts, why would this be used? Since we are indeed using his work for the generic GSI patches, we don’t want to replace his work at all, we want to take the value-added approach and provide the community an easy to use system that incorporates his work and uses everyone’s solutions on top of it to grow and benefit everyone exponentially. </p><p>For the PC side of things, this doesn’t mean the end of Bliss OS at all, in fact, Bliss OS is now part of all the PC ROMs that are built through AG. We will still be uploading Bliss OS builds too, but they will also be accompanied with  various other PC builds of different Android ROMs, and AOSP combinations.</p><p>This is where we need the Android community to start showing their support and try using the toolset. We’re not afraid of constructive criticism and are consistently working towards automating the entire process if possible. Help us help the community and git checkout Android-Generic today!</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">git clone https://gitlab.com/android-generic/vendor_android-generic vendor/android-generic</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_d4p0" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/2020-06-13-a-notice-on-bug-reporting">A notice on bug reporting</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_-Im+ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-06-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 13, 2020</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_8c0z"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_9q7L" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13326074?v=4" alt="Eric Park"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/ericswpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Eric Park</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Backend Engineer @ BlissLabs</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone! This is a quick notice on what’s going on behind the scenes, regarding bug reporting for our ROMs and firmware.</p><p>Right now <a href="https://github.com/BlissRoms/bug_reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we have a repository set up on GitHub for bug reporting.</a> However after using it for a couple of months we realized a couple of things:</p><ul><li>People really, really want unified bug reporting</li><li>Device bug reports are hard to handle</li><li>Source bug reports must be separate but it’s hard to distinguish in the sheer volume of bug reports</li></ul><p>That’s why we’re moving over our bug reporting system to Atlassian’s Jira. With the transition, we just want to let you guys know of a couple of things:</p><ul><li>Starting from today (June 13) we will no longer be accepting new bug reports at the aforementioned bug reporting repository.</li><li>In the future we will open access to Jira for the public and allow everyone to submit bug reports. No date has been set yet.</li><li>Jira will handle <strong>all</strong> bug reports, including BlissRoms and Bliss OS bug reports, device-specific bug reports, and more.</li></ul><p>We hope this clarifies a couple of things.
